## Purpose
While I'm well aware USB-PD->DC cables exist, these are preset to a specific voltage. Using the same USB-PD with different devices needing different voltages means unplugging and plugging in a different cable each time. There has to be a better solution, and thanks to Adafruit, we can make it!
