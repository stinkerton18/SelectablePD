## Purpose
While USB-PD->DC cables exist, these are preset to a specific voltage. Using the same USB-PD with different devices requiring different voltages means unplugging and plugging in a different cable for each device. There has to be a better solution, and thanks to Adafruit, we can make it!
This design uses 4 LED lit push button switches, and a 0.91 inch OLED screen, to choose from 5v (default), 9v, 12v, and 20v. When first turned on, 5v is chosen by default.

## Usage
The unit requires the following power inputs:
[cols=2*,options=]
|===
|5v to Arduino
| Ensure the Arduino receieves a consistent power output and preserve all available current through USB-PD is available for any devices you have connected.
| USB-PD
| The main power input. Please ensure your USB-PD power supply supports all of the voltages you plan to use.
|===
Pressing a specific voltage pushbutton results in that switch lighting up and the OLED screen displaying the currently operating voltage. If the selected voltage cannot be set, either due to a communications error or the USB-PD power source not supporting that voltage, an error will be displayed and the previously working voltage left enabled.

## Status
This is a work in progress, expect updates to be posted as time/testing permits

## Wiring Diagram
I've include both a checklist-type wiring diagram, and a Fritzing diagram in an effort to reach the widest audience of other makers.

Below is the table of Arduino Pins to component pins/pads, if there is an inline resistor, and a handy extra space to mark off when you've completed that connection.
