## Purpose
While I'm well aware USB-PD->DC cables exist, these are preset to a specific voltage. Using the same USB-PD with different devices needing different voltages means unplugging and plugging in a different cable each time. There has to be a better solution, and thanks to Adafruit, we can make it!
This design uses 4 LED lit push button switches, and a 0.91 inch OLED screen, to choose from 5v (default), 9v, 12v, and 20v. When first turned on, 5v is chosen by default.

## Usage
The unit requires the following power inputs:
[cols=2*,options=]
|===
|5v to Arduino
| Ensure the Arduino receieves a consistent power output and preserve all available current through USB-PD is available for any devices you have connected.
| USB-PD
| The main power input. Please ensure your USB-PD power supply supports all of the voltages you plan to use.
|===
Pressing a specific voltage pushbutton results in that switch lighting up and the OLED screen displaying the currently operating voltage. If the selected voltage cannot be set, either due to a communications error or the USB-PD power source not supporting that voltage, an error will be displayed and the previously working voltage left enabled.

## Status
This is a work in progress, expect updates to be posted as time/testing permits

### Done
[.list]
* Component List
* Pin count confirmation
* Arduino microcontroller restrictions confirmed
* Parts ordering
* Pinout and wiring confirmation
